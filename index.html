  <h3>Smartphones</h3>
  
  <p>A smartphone is a portable personal computer with a mobile operating system with features useful for handheld use. Smartphones, which are typically pocket-sized as opposed to tablets, which are much larger than a pocket and  have the ability to place and receive voice/video calls and create and receive text messages, have virtual assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, Bixby, a note-taking application, an event calendar, a media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet through a cellular network or Wi-Fi and can run a variety of third-party software components ("apps" from places like Google Play Store or Apple App Store). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen that enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words, numbers, and other characters, and press onscreen icons to activate "app" features.</p>
